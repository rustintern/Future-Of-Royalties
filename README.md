# Future-Of-Royalties
Sporting Labs is a decentralized sports betting protocol on Solana. Bettors can mint bets as NFTs, trade them on NFT AMM marketplaces and leverage their bets with NFT lending protocols. Here, we propose a mechanism by which users are incentivized to pay royalties for a chance to have their NFTs upgraded.

At the start of the F1 season, players can mint car components. Each component has a corresponding team and number. For example, there may be a a Ferrari front wing numbered 3. On the Friday of every race week, players can build their car consisting of up to 10 components and stake it for the weekend. If a player equips a Ferrari front wing numbered 3 for a race week, and any of the Ferrari drivers comes in third for that race, the player gets 10 points. Since there are 10 components, each player can earn a maximum of 100 points per race. The points are distributed in the form of soulbound tokens to the wallet address. All the SOL from the mint will be distributed to those with the most points accumulated at the end of the season.

A Ferrari component with a lower number may be as equially valuable as a Williams component with a higher number assigned. In fact, if the Williams is more consistent in its placing, it may be even more valuable. 

Through the season, new editions will be released. However, these will not be avaible to mint. Lets say Sheikh Roberto releases 20 gold Ferrari front wings (max bidding), instead of releasing them as a separate collection, players can purchase existing Ferrari front wings with royalties for a chance to have theirs upgraded.

Recently there has been a lot of discussion and anger concerning the ability for Metaplex to update the metadata of NFTs. However, we see this as a possible solution. If a player purchases a component and pays royalties, there is a probability that their token's metadata will be updated to the new editions released. We think this will incentivize players to pay royalties when events are going on. We have included an example of this infrustructure so that projects on Solana can adopt this for themselves.

Artists who collaborate during these events will get a large proportion of the royalties paid during the event. We hope Solana native artists like John LÃª, Zen0m and Cooky will collaborate with us on such events, perhaps leading up to a launch of theirs or a festival they enjoy. 

We will be launching this hybrid of a fantasy league and a betting platform for the 2023 F1 season. This is just the beginning and we will be creating a different game for each sport as Sporting Labs continues to grow. The betting platform as described in the other submissions will run concurrently with these fantasy leagues.
